CURRENT USAGE CONDITIONS:

Since Gasoline is still private (as well as ChaNGa with the modern
Gasoline features), our policy is: they are offered for use on a
project by project basis, and for each project the user should offer
authorship to the current primary developers (James Wadsley, Tom Quinn,
and Derek Richardson) as well as whomever those developers suggest.

			PKDGRAV - Parallel Gravity Code

			Author: Joachim Stadel

Version Description:

* pkdgrav-0.1

	This is the initial parallel gravity code. It uses mdl-0.2 and is 
fully portable. This version uses bounds on partial errors only, and
thus performs a straight forward tree walk. The code creates an interaction
list for an entire bucket, thereby amortizing the tree-walking costs over
all the particles in a bucket. No support for periodic boundary conditions
is included as of this version.

* pkdgrav-0.2

	This is the version which is/was run initially on Cornell's KSR-1
parallel computer. It supports periodic BC's and comoving coordinates.
The correct quadrupole form of spline softening has been added to the
code (see grav.c & grav.h).

* pkdgrav-0.3
	
	This is a start on instrumenting the code for multistepping.
