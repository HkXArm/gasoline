## EXTRA KERNELS
WENDLAND              #Use the Wendland C_2 Kernel (See Dehnen & Aly 2012)
HSHRINK               #M4 kernel times (pi/6)^(1/3) for a tighter kernel
M43D                  #Use a fancier 3D derived M4 Kernel
PEAKEDKERNEL          #Use a modified Peaked M4 kernel as per Thomas and Couchman 92 (Bibcode:1992MNRAS.257...11T)
QUINTIC               #Use a quintic spline kernel from Dehnen & Aly 2012 (Bibcode:2012MNRAS.425.1068D)

## DENSITYU
DENSITYU              #Calculate modified energy-weighted density (used for cooling) (good for large density gradients)
DENSITYUNOTP          #More aggressive version of the energy-weighted density that ignores contribution from center

## VARIOUS COOLING HACKS
FUVSHIELD             #Alter the amount of FUV shielding?
WOLFIRE_NOTWOPHASE    #Use an imposed cooling rate without a two-phase instability
WOLFIRE               #Use the Wolfire values for the metal cooling rate with UV heating
USETABLE              #Grab the cooling rates from a table
NOFIT                 #Don't use any fitting for the cooling rates without H2 in cooling_metal_noH2.c
PARTSHEAR             #Use particle shear for the correlation length in H2 cooling 
NEWSHEAR              #Use the diffusion length for the correlation length in the H2 code from Charlotte Christensen
CLOUDY                #Use CLOUDY version of line cooling
BATEPOLY              #Use the default cooling polynomial COOLING_POLY
MODBATEPOLY           #Use a modified polytropic equation of state with COOLING_BATE
SUPERCOOL             #Enable "Supercool" type particles (just gas particles with mean velocities?)
RADIATIVEBOX          #Estimate Local Lyman-Werner radiation from the tree

## EXTRA SF CRITERIA
DIVVOFF               #Remove the convergent flow requirement for starformation
SCFSMOOTHED           #Use smoothed masses for star cluster formation (-DSTARCLUSTFORM)
SFBOUND               #Use a surface-density criteria for allowing star formation.
SFCONDITIONS          #Use additional conditions for deciding if you form stars (Jeans length vs. h)
SFEVENTCRIT           #Log additional star formation criteria
STARSINK              #Star particles are also sink partikes. (Requires -DSINKING)
STARCLUSTERFORM       #Make new stars using the clustered star formation recipe
JEANSSF               #Use a simple Jeans length criteria for starformation

## VARIOUS HYDRO HACKS
PRES_HK               #Use the Euclidean mean of the both pOverRho values to calculate PdV work
PRES_MONAGHAN         #Use Monaghan's PdV work calculation (the average of both pOverRho values)
SMOOTHBSW             #Use a smoothed Balsara switch
RTDENSITY             #Use an Ritchie & Thomas densities (DOI:10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04268.x)
RTF                   #-DRTDENSITY and -DRTFORCE 
VARALPHA              #Allow a varying alpha artificial viscosity 
PONRHOFLOOR           #Minimum P/rho value, prevents floating point errors in some cases
NODIFFUSIONTHERMAL    #Disable thermal diffusion
DENSSOFT              #Use the SPH density for gravity softening

## PERFORMANCE/GRAVITY STUFF
TZKEY64               #Use 64 (instead of 128) bit keys for the tree. Faster, but allows less depth.
SINGLE                #Use single precision floats where possible
NEED_VPRED            #Calculate a predicted veloctiy (this is defined all over, I'm unsure as to its signifigance)
GR_DRAG               #Enable Frame dragging
