TOPHATFEEDBACK        #Use a tophat kernel to smooth feedback over

## GRAVITY AND HYDRODYNAMICS
GASOLINE              #Do hydro 
CULLENDEHNEN          #Use the time-variable CD viscosity limit switch
VARALPHA              #Allow a varying alpha artificial viscosity 
NSMOOTHINNER          #Ensure at least 18 neighbours inside 1.41 h
PEXT                  #Allow non-zero external pressure 
JEANSSOFT             #Calculate presure floor to keep jeans length larger than softening or sph h (default is just sph h)
JEANSSOFTONLY         #Calculate presure floor to keep jeans length larger than softening only
INFLOWOUTFLOW         #Enable inflow/outflow boundary conditions
PARTICLESPLIT         #Particles will now divide if they get too heavy
OUTURBDRIVER          #Drive turbulence as in Price & Federrath 2010 with OU variables
ROT_FRAME             #Use a rotating reference frame with rotation rate given by dOmega
SIMPLE_GAS_DRAG       #Apply a drag to the gas velocities using either the Epstein regime, or stopping time

## INITIAL CONDITION BUILDING
GLASS                 #Use this to damp for glass initial conditions
GLASSZ                #Use this to damp for glass IC in z direction

## OUTPUT VISUALIZATION
GSS_DUMPFRAME         #Dumpframe that allows coloring by particle property (Greg's version)
VOXEL                 #Dump voxels for volume imaging.

## SINK PARTICLES
SINKINGAVERAGE        #I believe this prevents sink particles from evolving with time? (Requires -DSINKING)
