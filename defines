## COLLISIONS AND PLANET FORMATION
AGGS                  #Include support for aggregates (like asteroids and rubble piles) See aggs.c
COLLISIONS            #Use solid-body collisions (not compatible with -DGASOLINE)
GROWMASS              #Allow collisional particles to grow
N_DIM                 #Number of dimensions to use for solar system calculations (Defaults to 3)
SURFACEAREA           #Calculate and output the surface area of all the particles.
NORMAL                #Calculate and output surface normals for particles (Needs -DSURFACEAREA)
RUBBLE_ZML            #Use "Rubble Pile" collision model (Requires -DCOLLISION)
SAND_PILE             #Use the "Sand Pile" collision model (Requires -DCOLLISION)
SLIDING_PATCH         #Alternative collision scheme (I don't really know what this does) (Requires -DCOLLISIONS)
TUMBLER               #Generate a hard-walled cylinder boundary (for use with collisions and sand piles)

## STAR FORMATION AND FEEDBACK
STARFORM              #Make new stars according to the starformation recipe
CHABRIER              #Use the Chabrier 2003 IMF for starformation (See DOI:10.1086/376392)
KROUPA01              #Use the newer Kroupa 01 IMF (DOI:10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04022.x)
KROUPA                #Use the Kroupa IMF (from Kroupa et al 1993 Bibcode:1993MNRAS.262..545K)
FEEDBACKDIFFLIMIT     #Disable thermal diffusion for particles that have their cooling shut off
TOPHATFEEDBACK        #Use a tophat kernel to smooth feedback over
VOLUMEFEEDBACK        #Smooth FB energy over a volume rather than mass
UNONCOOL              #Enable noncooling energy for feedback
SUPERBUBBLE			  #Use the Keller+ 2014 Superbubble feedback 

## GRAVITY AND HYDRODYNAMICS
GASOLINE              #Do hydro 
CULLENDEHNEN          #Use the time-variable CD viscosity limit switch
DIFFUSION             #Enable Diffusion (of metals and energy)
JEANSSOFT             #Calculate presure floor to keep jeans length larger than softening or sph h (default is just sph h)
JEANSSOFTONLY         #Calculate presure floor to keep jeans length larger than softening only
INFLOWOUTFLOW         #Enable inflow/outflow boundary conditions
PARTICLESPLIT         #Particles will now divide if they get too heavy
OUTURBDRIVER          #Drive turbulence as in Price & Federrath 2010 with OU variables
WENDLANDC4            #Use the Wendland C_4 Kernel (See Dehnen & Aly 2012)
ROT_FRAME             #Use a rotating reference frame with rotation rate given by dOmega
SIMPLE_GAS_DRAG       #Apply a drag to the gas velocities using either the Epstein regime, or stopping time

## INITIAL CONDITION BUILDING
GLASS                 #Use this to damp for glass initial conditions
GLASSZ                #Use this to damp for glass IC in z direction

## OUTPUT VISUALIZATION
GSS_DUMPFRAME         #Dumpframe that allows coloring by particle property (Greg's version)
VOXEL                 #Dump voxels for volume imaging.

## SINK PARTICLES
SINKINGAVERAGE        #I believe this prevents sink particles from evolving with time? (Requires -DSINKING)
SINKING               #Include support for sink particles
